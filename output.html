Continuing w/ C/assembly, it would be helpful in learning more about assembly.
i thought we might explain the systems of programming and the individual parts to a program,
as well as how a higher level language influences the lower level.

Theres 4 main parts to what i call, an **asm-code program**. It will be a simple test that
compiles and generates an `asm-code.out`...

**Structure members**
Demonstrating how structures (struct in C) are laid out in memory and how their members' offsets
are calculated and used in assembly.

**Create function**
We focus on how functions are created, including how functions are defined and called in C versus
how they are translated into assembly which'll illustrate the concept of procedure calls, stack management,
and pointer usage in a very hands-on manner.

**Use function**
To continue w/ systems of programming, we want to create another function that actually uses our last function,
as you want to design things in such a way where every function is being used in some way by the rest of the
program and not just hanging around for no reason. Therefore we'll be integrating the `printf` function, which
also helps us demonstrate the use of a function, the linkage to an external library and how data (like char type)
are passed to such functions, which'll reasonably bridge the gap between C code and assembly.

**Initialization &amp; entry point**
To have a valid program, there has to be a variable and/or function call inside of `int main` that tells our program
what first to do (declarations can go above it, but definitions have to be below `int main`, or exist in another file (which case they are `extern`)).
So we'll detail how global variables and functions are initialized and the significance of the main function as the entry point of the program.
ps. Definitions of functions and global variables can appear above main if they are being implemented in another file/ header
