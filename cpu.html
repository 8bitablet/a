<em>The following is a very rough, compact description of
how i view the internals of the cpu, starting with
'dram' and then everything from the cpu's perspective.
This is what i have come to understand <b>so far</b>
and should in no way be taken as a total understanding.
It is not my intention to supply such an explanation.
It is however an attempt to summarize things simply
and portray the significance of understanding
everything from the perspective of memory cells
and logic gates.
Keep in mind, this is only a basic description of a processor
even still everything is just tiny wires, capacitors and
transistors carrying an electrical charge; We'll explain
further as to what that means.</em>

Part 2 How computer = cpu.register>>dram?
[fetch][decode][execute]

Storage in dram is volatile. But dram is intimately connected w/ the cpu
and its ability to calculate as well as in determining which instruction to perform.
And this cpu.register>>dram relationship has an affinite connection with the rest of
the computer/hardware, or 'device drivers'; in terms of this loop,
 <em>cpu -> to a storage device -> and back to cpu.register>>dram</em>.
So coupled w/ the real-time clock, used to keep counting, in conjuction with the
low standby power CMOS Static RAM, ssd/hdd retain a small level of voltage/or charge
to keep memory persistent. In conclusion its safe, but not recommended to unplug
storage drives and keep it unhoused from its host netgate.

register = (a simple register) in cell terms is a group of flip-flop circuits
that store 1 or 0. There are many different kinds of registers, but this one
is for storing a binary word, and one flip-flop is needed for each bit in the word.
What are the internals of a flip-flop?!__!

A register in physicality is itself a storage element for addresses.
During the fetch phase, it is meant to retrieve an instruction from dram.
The Address register is wired into dram. dram interprets that as a value and then
sends back the associated address to the Instruction register. Next, opcode,
or the first 4 bits of the address corresponds to Load-A instruction.
The other bits of the address correspond to a dram address.
Next, instructions are decoded and interpreted by the Control Unit.

controlunit= (a handful of logic gates) it recognizes Load-A instruction circuit
by matching the opcodes 4 bit address. The physical circuit layout IS the match.
In other words, each transistor will output the opcode correctly or not.
Which leads to the execute phase. The output of that Load-A checking instruction
turns on dram's read/enable line and sends the remaining bits of the dram address.
dram retrieves the value at that address. Because it stems from a Load-A instruction,
the value has to be stored in register A, (none of the other registers).
When dram's data wires are wired to 4 data registers, the Load-A match circuit turns
on the write/enable of only register A. For the next instruction, everything is
turned off. The Address register is then incremented by 1 bit,
and we do the entire process again.
Again Control Unit is responsible for selecting the right registers to pass in as
inputs and to configure the ALU to perform the right operation.
So for example, the Control Unit enables register B and feeds its value into the
first input of the ALU. It also enables register A and feeds that into the second
input of the ALU.
The 'add' instruction determined by the opcode, is a 2 bit address. The add opcode
is passed into the ALU. The output will be saved to register A. For this,
the Control Unit uses an internal register of its own to temporarily save the output,
turn off the ALU and then write the value into the proper register.
Then we begin again, incrementing the Address register by 1 bit.
It goes through the usual fetch and decode. The address is then passed to dram
but this time its a 'STORE' instruction. So instead of read-enabling, it write-enables.
At the same time it read-enables register A. This opens the data line to
pass in the value stored in from register A.

clock = triggers an electrical signal within specific intervals.
it advances the operation of the cpu, corresponding with specific registers.
What are the internals of TODO!__!
[<em>Describe a pulse transition detector here</em>]

mmu = is a memory unit responsible for mapping addresses to ram.
It keeps track of shifts between virtual and physical addresses.

cache = a storage element. it is sram, by which it does not have
a refresh step. It finds application in the correspondence of main memory blocks
and those in the cache. This is specified by the specific mapping instruction.
Cache internally is also a group of flip-flop gates.

framebuffer = a portion of dram containing a bitmap that drives a video display,
a buffer being a region of memory used to store data. There are many different
kinds of buffers. A framebuffer in particular represents all the pixels in a frame.
The implementation of a pixel comes out of the cpu, which depends on the monitors
specifications. To setup a pixel internally, 8 bits are sent to the display controller.
That display controller turns these bits into an analog voltage level
(according to the monitor specifications).
A voltage level is produced, advancing pixel by a specific amount.
1 pixel is represented for red, green and blue. So that means you send (3) sets of 8 bits
Each row of the screen will need 1920 pixels and each column 1080 pixels.
This grid is considered the 'display'. For each pixel sends (3x) 8 bits of data to feed the
image to the screen. 1920 * 1080 * 3 bytes (or 24 bits)
= 6220800 bytes (or 5.93 megabytes)
The screen refreshes (60x) per sec. That means it sends the display 1 new frame of 6 mb
(of your picture) (60x) per sec.
360 mb of bits per sec.
There's also the intensity of a pixel which can be described by an incremental circuit
of some sort. For color you can make a function normalizing the 3 bit channel definition,
or 4 because you want alpha channel.
Again this process comes in and out of the cpu, however the gpu has its own framebuffer.
