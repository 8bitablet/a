  #define b(n) (2 &lt;&lt; (n))
  #define a(n) ((b(n))-1)</span>

this macro shifts 2, to the left (n)bits, and subtracts 1.
if you call b(3), it would be equivalent to 2 &lt;&lt; 3, resulting in 16
if you call a(3), it would be equivalent to (2 &lt;&lt; 3) - 1
resulting in 15, which is a binary number with three bits set to 1 (111 in binary)
<span class="alt-text">
  printf("b is %d\n", b(3));
  printf("a is %d\n", a(3));</span>

8 in binary = 1000
4 in binary = 0100
2 in binary = 0010
1 in binary = 0001

3 in binary is a combination of 1 and 2, yadayada... Instead if we start with 2
and shift it over three places to the left, we have 100000, and 1 is in the 16th spot
making it 16

give these examples time to marinate, the Taj Mahal wasnt built
in a day and neither was our memory and ability to grasp things

<span class="alt-text">
  #define MY_MACRO(ptr)  ((*ptr) * 2)</span>

and you use it as follows:
<span class="alt-text">
  int array[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  int *ptr = array;
  int result = MY_MACRO(ptr);</span>

during preprocessing, `MY_MACRO(ptr)` will be replaced with `((*ptr) * 2)`
the `(*ptr)` is just a textual replacement that occurs before actual compilation


these are variations of the backslash (\) character
in which it cancels-out the proceeding character
but in any other case an escape sequence is determined by the proceeding character e.g. "\n" newline
<span class="alt-text">
  char s1[] = "Ca\\ncel";
  char s2[] = "Ca\134ncel";
  char s3[] = "Ca\x5Cncel";</span>

technically speaking, the backslash is an ID token that goes until it hits whitespace
in which case it might have the effect of continuating a line (or removing the line break
whichever way u prefer to see it) which may fall into the running logic of the rest of the code

youll gain an interest in macros and the application of strings
as your brain unlocks the harder-to-grok details

<span class="alt-text">
  #define QUOTE(seq) "\""#seq"\""

  int main() {
    printf("%s\n", QUOTE(sequence));
  return 0;
  }</span>

preserves the " " air-quotes around sequence

the __preprocessor__ also has specific ways in which it expands a variable
such being, during the # hash operator


the next example demonstrates an offset (youll remember we explained how
structs use offsets to access members)
note: on my machine 'size_t' is a 64 bit unsigned int
<span class="alt-text">
  #define offset(s,m) ((size_t) &amp; (((s*)0)-&gt;m))

  struct s {
    char *a;
    int b;
    size_t c;
  };

  int main() {
    printf("a -- %zu\n", offset(struct s, a));
    printf("b -- %zu\n", offset(struct s, b));
    printf("c -- %zu\n", offset(struct s, c));
    return 0;
  }</span>

`(*s)` dereferences the pointer to the structure.
`(*s)-&gt;m` accesses the member `m` within the structure.
`&amp;((*s)-&gt;m)` gets the address of the member within the structure.
`(size_t) &amp;((*s)-&gt;m)` casts this address to `size_t`
and then, from __main__ our macro, *offset(struct..* takes 2 arguments `struct s, x`
