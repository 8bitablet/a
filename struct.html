structures are a contiguous block of memory and
the fields (members) are accessed using offsets
<span class="alt-text">
  |   x   |   y   |
  ----------
  |   10  |   20  |</span>

x is at offset 0 within the struct
y is at offset `sizeof(int)` bytes within the struct

structs can store any data type and
you can create them like this
<span class="alt-text">
  struct example {
    int x;
    int y;
  };</span>

using a struct within a function might look like
<span class="alt-text">
  void function(){
    struct example newname;
    struct example *something = &amp;newname;
  }<span>

you can then declare a variable (newname) in this case
that points to x or y in the original struct, and same for
(something), which it now equals the address of member

anyway, when you see this `Object.Member, its referred to as a Member that is
being accessed through the pointer to Object... you use the dot when there's
direct access, and the (-&gt;) arrow operator when its indirect...
`newname.x` could be declared w/ direct access
`something-&gt;x` would have indirect access, seeing
as its two levels away from `example`

but lets not cram everything in at once
lets go through this slowly

you can declare a struct like this
<span class="alt-text">
  struct example newA;</span>

you can also construct them as an anonymous structs w/ a tag
<span class="alt-text">
  struct {
      int x;
      int y;
  } example;</span>

using typedef to create an alias for the struct
<span class="alt-text">
  typedef struct example example;</span>

lets you declare w/ `example` as opposed to `struct example`
i.e. it lets you create a type alias

adding `typedef` is most typically done like this
<span class="alt-text">
  typedef struct {
      int x;
      int y;
  } example;</span>

and since youve already included `typedef`, you can omit the `struct` keyword
in the declaration
<span class="alt-text">
  example newA;</span>

quick note, typedef also means that the type (in this case `example`)
is available for use as a type of function..
<span class="alt-text">
  example CreateFunction(){
  }</span>

`typedef` in a struct definition not only creates a type alias
but also makes the struct name visible in a broader scope
designated intializers provide a way of explicitly
intitializing struct members
<span class="alt-text">
  typedef struct DeviceInfo {
    int deviceID;
    char description[50];
  } DeviceInfo;

  typedef struct {
    int ex;
  } ExtID;</span>

ExtID can now be used as the type of a function
or as the type in a parameter as well
for now, like i said, lets try to keep things
as simple as possible... we have two devices
of type `DeviceInfo`, that have an id and description
<span class="alt-text">
  DeviceInfo device1 = {1, "Device 1"};
  DeviceInfo device2 = {2, "Device 2"};</span>

structID to access member id for demonstration
through the access member, we can assign the
to their respect devices
<span class="alt-text">
  ExtID A = {.ex = device1.deviceID};
  ExtID B = {.ex = device2.deviceID};</span>

Accessing and printing device information
<span class="alt-text">
  printf("Device A - ID: %d, Description: %s\n", A.ex, device1.description);
  printf("Device B - ID: %d, Description: %s\n", B.ex, device2.description);</span>

there's also unions which use less memory, however
only one member of its allocated memory is used as it
assigns one common storage space for all its members

and an enum is for when you want to create, whats called
"enumerated constants"
