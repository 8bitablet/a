        I wrote a poem, "NOR's Adventure", to remember binary bitwise operators..

        " Unary <b>NOT</b> flips a row of bits
        Unless they're already off, which
        <b>OR</b> would insist...  That they all turn 'on', so good for him..
        "<b>AND</b>"ing cuts the power, unless the power's in each bin.
        And bins are made to break, therefore
        <b>NOR</b> ensures a state.. that each bit turn off unless
        they're off which he awakes (on)..
        <b>XOR</b> goes cross-eyed, and makes his conditient,
        that everything similar turn off unless they're precisely different.
        indifferently, NOR turns off+off back on and feels ashame,
        </b>NAND</b> turns all on if they're all -
        not fully powered a'gain (yay!) "
        
        next lets demonstrate computing an expression A'*B'+B*C:
        
                   A: -----.
                   B: ---. |
                   C: -. | |
                         | | `-&lt;o-|&amp;&amp;--.
                         | }---&lt;o-|&amp;&amp;  `-|OR
                         | |          ,--|OR----A'*B'+B*C
                         | `------|&amp;&amp;-'
                         `--------|&amp;&amp;
        
        A′ represents the negation (NOT) of A.
        B′B′ represents the negation (NOT) of B.
        A′⋅B′A′⋅B′ represents the logical AND of the negation of A and the negation of B.
        B⋅CB⋅C represents the logical AND of B and C.
        The final result is the logical OR of A′⋅B′A′⋅B′ and B⋅CB⋅C
        
        
        simulate NOR behavior: (~) NOT'ing the result of (|) OR
        
                    A: -----.
                    B: ---. |
                          | |
                          | | `-&lt;o-|OR--.
                          | }---&lt;o-|OR  `-|NOT
                          | |      `------|NOT----A NOR B
                          | `------|NOT
                          `--------|OR
