<div id="arr-anch">fly^p4rray</div>
<span class="alt-text">
  int arr[4];</span>

if `int arr[4] = ...`, were to equal something
then we could gain access and receive a
normal integer value when specifying its index.
the index of an array is random when uninitialized
or else its determined by the initializer e.g.
<span class="alt-text">
  int arr[] = {3, 4, 5};</span>

what is the size of this array?
just count the elements starting from 0

all these kinds of arrays are fixed, and their size will
be determined at compile time...
<span class="alt-text">
  int arr[var] = {a, b, c};</span>

thats not to say you cant allocate a new array w/
a larger size and copy the existing elements from
the old array to the new one (then, continue adding elements)

you would just need to use the same method we showed for
assigning one function to another...
<span class="alt-text">
  int MaxSize = 5;
  int *FixedArray = (int*)malloc(MaxSize * sizeof(int));</span>

and then you would iterate over the array in a forloop adding
<span class="alt-text">
   FixedArray[i] = i + 1;</span>

increasing the size and copy the existing elements to the
new array, and add the elements to the new array.

`(int*)` is referred to as type casting, youll see this alot in C
as its to assure the type compatibility when assigning another variable
that may or may not be allowed; The compiler will perform this conversion
implicitly and issue warnings for implicit conversions that could result in
data loss... there's a hierarchy of specific casting levels allowed/not allowed

`malloc` is just a function w/ a `size_t`(atleast 16bit) parameter
and you'll come across it more as you progress
<span class="alt-text">
  void *malloc(size_t size)</span>

/* see `malloc` on page8 */
