<em>shell</em>
<em>~</em>  home directory    <em>/</em>  root directory

Shell is a command interpreter intended for both interactive
and shell-script use.
Command plus a single period <b>.</b> refers to your
current working directory.
Change directory, <b>cd</b> traverses you forward or backward
to a relative or absolute file path.

Backslash <b>\</b> allows a command to be continued,
prompted on the following command line. It's also
what's known as an 'escape character'

Comments <b>#</b> are made w/ hashtag, a special character.
When used as a sha-bang <b>#!</b> it tells your system
which interpreter to use to parse the rest of the file;

  <b>./example_script.sh</b>

Or you can override by explicitly specifying the shell and
writing the filename of your script to run it.

dollar sign <b>$</b> is a meta-character/sigil and
tells the shell the next word is a variable.
Of course within quotation marks its considered a regular
character, as Quoted characters do not have a special meaning.
Quotes are unique in that they behave like a toggle.

A variable is a character-<a href="strings">string</a> in shell that stores
some value. That value could be an integer, filename,
string or some shell command itself.
A command is a program interpreted by the system.

<em>If your interests lie in understanding what a
a shell is and its inner workings, you could
look up: parser, executor and shell subsystems;
Or see a list of <a href="h/helpcmd">commands</a>.</em>

  <b>variable=value</b>

Putting a space before or after <b>=</b> equals different results.
This will be demonstrated as we go on.

Setting a variable to an empty string looks something like:
  <b>variable=""</b>

Environment variables are a mechanism that passes information
to all processes, created by a parent process. By default
there are typically some pre-assigned variables.
Every program will inherit these variables.
The information flow is one-way, meaning shell script cannot
change the current directory(parent).

There are two different kinds of variables.
Environment variables that are exported to all processes
spawned by the shell. Their settings can be seen with the env command.
A subset of environment variables, such as PATH, affects the behavior
of the shell itself..

.. <b>Local</b> variables affect only the current shell instance;

To access the value stored in a variable, prefix its name with
the dollar sign <b>$</b> The following script will access the
value of defined variable NAME and print it to stdout;

  <b>NAME="Marco_Polo"</b>
  <b>echo $NAME</b>

... or how about passing an argument to a script?
Typically we think of this format w/ a command and file:
<em><b>a-w</b> sets <b>w</b>ritable 'off' for All-&gt;(user,group,other),
regardless of set bit occupation, henceforth this file would be
considered a "write-protected regular file"</em>

  <b>chmod a-w ./example</b>

But there's also positional parameters that pass in commands
like this <em>(will explain further on)</em>.

  <b>./example.sh 1 2 3</b>

You can find out what an individual variable is set to e.g.

  <b>echo $WHATEVER</b>

<b>$PS1</b> specifies the prompt printed before each command.
Usually this is <em>$</em>
  <b>$PS2</b>
.. defines the secondary prompt, the prompt you see after
multi-line commands such as <b>for</b> or <b>if</b>.

  <b>echo $HOME</b>
.. is the equivalent of <b>echo /home/user</b>
or whatever your home directory is.

<b>$PATH</b> variable lists directories that contain commands.
If we have several commands in there, the directories are
searched in the order specified. An empty string corresponds to
your current directory.

<b>$CDPATH</b> sets a path that tells the <b>cd</b> command where to search.
For example if you set <b>CDPATH=$HOME</b>, you can <b>cd</b> to
any subdirectory of $HOME from the current directory you are in.

  <b>ls /your/directory</b>
<em>ls: cannot access '/your/directory': No such file or directory</em>

  <b>mkdir /your/directory</b>

Anytime i use the <b>rm</b> command i follow it up with <b>-ir</b>
as ive personally deleted things accidently. OR, having
a "write-protected regular file" permission set from the
start is preferable.
The same thing using <b>mv</b>, as i recommend using <b>cp</b>
over mv when applicable.
With that said, i find this behavior insightful;

  <b>rm -i</b> <em>file1 file2</em>

The shell breaks this line up into four words.
The first word is the command/program to execute.
The next three are passed to the program as three
arguments. So the program <b>rm</b> looks at the first
argument, realizes it is an option -<em>because of the hyphen</em>,
and treats the next two arguments as filenames.

  <b>echo</b> "The directory your in is <b>$PWD</b>/filename.jpg"
  <em>The directory your in is /currentdir/filename.jpg</em>

For command substitution <b>$(command)</b> is considered
the proper method, here's an example of that;

  <b>A=$(expr $A + 2)</b>
  <b>echo "$A</b> inefficient yet simple"

Single quotes would treat everything as plain characters.

<em>.. will explain expr and entr further on</em>
<b>set</b> without an argument will list shell variables,
shell functions, and environment variables.
It can set or unset with the <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> option.
It can be used with positional parameters for example:

  <b>set apple banana carrot</b>

This will set <b>apple</b> to correspond to the <b>$1</b>
parameter, <b>banana</b> to <b>$2</b>, and <b>carrot</b> to <b>$3</b>
 <em>(..will explain further on)</em>

You can set and export in one line.

  <b>export APPLE="my apple"</b>

<b>unset</b> can be used to undefine any variable.

The <b>export</b> command is necessary to update the environment
variable. It lists all the exported variables;

For environment variables to persist they must be set in file.
By default these are hidden files in your system's root.
However you can setup a user to have environment variables
in the <b>/etc</b> designated for system configurations,
then <b>../environment</b> which should already exist.
  <b>ls -a home/user</b>
should also contain familiar configuration files.

<b>$IFS</b> is the "Input Field Seperator"
IFS is a special variable which lists the characters used to terminate a word.
Whitespace is what separates characters. This variable contains
a space, a tab, and a newline.

<em>If you are unsure about overriding your main IFS..
you can set a different variable to it before hand like this;</em>

  <b>OLDIFS=$IFS</b>

<b>env</b> allows you to run another program in a custom environment
without modifying the current one. Without specifying an argument it
will list the current environment variables.

You can imagine that a program generates a child process.
And this process has the same environment as its parent.
The process ID number is different, and this is typically referred
to as 'forking'. Forking provides a way for an existing process to
start a new one. However, there may be situations where a child process
is not part of the same program as the parent process. In this case
<b>exec</b> is used. It will execute a program; however
the command-to-follow replaces the current shell -&gt; which means
no subshell is created during this ~ and the 'current process'
is replaced with this new command.

<em>ls, du, find and grep</em> are good examples of commands to get started w/

  <b>ls</b>  is used to list files and directories.

<b>help command</b> to view the help page for a command <b>help help</b> for help -options
and <b>man command</b> to view a man page, <b>man man</b>  traverse page; <em>e, f, z, d, PgDn
y, b, w, u, PgUp</em> <b>info</b> command to view a command in stand-alone info pages.</a>

  <b>du -hs </b> h for human readable, s for total bytes w/ no recursion

FIND PATH TYPE NAME are the keywords that help me remember which order of
options proceeds after <b>find</b>
Keep in mind <b>-iname "example"</b> will not look for joined names such as
<b>"anexample"</b>, however you can solve this when using <b>*</b> in a pattern.

  <b>find / -type f -iname "*thisword*"</b>

Basically we wrote look from the <b>/</b> directory of type <b>f</b>ilename
for case-insensitive name "*thisword*", where the <b>*</b> is to avoid globbing.
<em>In regular expressions a <b>.</b> dot is the pattern which matches any single
character~combined with the asterisk operator <b>.*</b> it will match any number
of any characters.</em>
<b>find</b> does a recursive search on any file or path in quotes, provided that the
expression is successfully matched. There is other case-insensitive options
such as <b>-ilname  -iregex  -iwholename</b>..

Pattern matching for words within files is accomplished with grep;

  <b>grep -i "this" script.sh</b>

Case-insensitive search for 'this' inside script.sh

  <b>grep -nr 'yourstring*' . </b>

..Recursively search through current directory for string w/ -n (line numbers)
As a linux dev, you will quickly find that your workflow benefits from a new system;
One that resorts to writing shell scripts during both: a task and learning how the
system works. It is recommended to defer from CLI to writing a script if your input
needs a layer of complexity that the PS1 would otherwise get in the way of.

<a style="color:#646464; font-family:consolas,monospace; font-style:regular; font-size:14">
<em>Every now and then you'll end up in a less tha desirable situation,
where you either have a crashed/frozen terminal session, or you may have
accidentally pressed a sequence of keys such as Alt+op+Backspace which
can causes the cursor to start writing/erasing into the prompt;
although you should be able to press Ctrl+C to interrupt,
Ctrl+D for End-of-file signal,
or Ctrl+Z to suspend currently running process.
You can use   Shift+Alt+C  or  Ctrl+Alt+Fn2  to open an alternate
tty session, where you can run <b>kill</b> from there.</em></a>

Most Unix text facilities are line-oriented that search
for patterns spanning several lines.
The end-of-line character <b>$</b> is not included in
the block of text that is searched. It is a separator,
and regular expressions examine the text between the
separators. If you want to search for a pattern that is
at one end or the other, you use anchors.

Caret <b>^</b> is the starting anchor.
The regular expression <b>^A</b> will match all lines
that start with an uppercase A. The expression <b>A$</b>
will match all lines that end with uppercase A.
If the anchor characters are not used at the proper end
of the pattern, they no longer act as anchors;
That is, the <b>^</b> is an anchor only if it is the
first character in a regular expression.

Dollar sign <b>$</b> is an anchor only if it is the last character.
If you need to match a <b>^</b> at the beginning of the line or
a <b>$</b> at the end of a line, you must escape the special
character by typing a backslash <b>\</b> before it.

So <b>$1,$2..$9</b> are known as <em>Positional <b>Parameters</b></em>,
with emphasis on 'parameter', as they take on the value
of the corresponding parameter.
The <b>$</b> sign is just a variable. The number
that follows indicates the position on the command line.
<b>$0</b> represents the actual name of the script.
<b>$1</b> indicates the first parameter. <b>$2</b> indicates
the second parameter and so on.
Here's another example in the context of a script;

  <b>echo "param = $1"</b>
  <b>echo "param = $2"</b>

or passed in as an argument;

  <b>./testfile 4 5</b>

<b>$*</b> Asterisk is similar to the filename
meta-character, in that it matches all arguments.

<b>$@</b> is similar to <b>$*</b>, except it retains
the spaces found in the variable.

<b>$#</b> is equal to the number of arguments passed
to the script.

<b>$$</b> variable corresponds to the process ID of the
current shell running the script. Every process has a
different identification number. This is useful when
picking a unique temporary filename. The following will
select a unique filename, use it, then delete it;

<b>$!</b> indicates process ID of the process executed
with an ampersand, an asynchronous or background process.
You do something else and wait for a background process.

<b>$?</b> equal to the error returned from the previous
program.

<b>$-</b> corresponds to certain internal variables in
the shell.

The other class of variables are called flags or options.
They are not read like a regular variable.
They are boolean and internal to the shell.
<em>However i find its best to think of an option as an
'_extension' to a command, as opposed to some
parameter of related letters, as every command
is unique, so you cant assume so anyway.</em>
They do not take assignment with <b>=</b>
instead you use the <b>set</b> command.

When trying to understand a script better, there is
<b>-x</b> and <b>-v</b> options.
<b>-v</b> echoes the line as it is read,
while the <b>-x</b> option echoes as it's executed..
<em>.. with <b>+</b> preceding each line.</em>

<b>-n</b> will read a script and parse commands,
but it does not execute. <b>-e</b> immediately exits
the script if an error is present.
<b>-t</b> executes one line and then exits.

<b>-a</b> , all variables that have been modified
or created are exported.
Streams and File descriptors, brief introduction
When you want to do input or output to a file,
you have a choice of two basic mechanisms for representing
the connection between your program and the file:
File descriptors and Streams.
File descriptors are represented as objects of type int,
while streams are represented as FILE * objects.
Both file descriptors and streams can represent a connection
to a device (such as a terminal), or a pipe or socket for
communicating with another process, as well as a normal file.
Each Unix process has three standard POSIX file descriptors,
corresponding to the three standard streams:
Standard Input (stdin), Standard output (stdout),
and Standard error (stderr). They can be used for
a file or other I/O resource such as a pipe.

Evaluation, pipelines, in this example;

  <b>cmd1 ; cmd2 ; cmd3 ; cmd4</b>
  <b>cmd1 & cmd2 & cmd3 & cmd4</b>
  <b>cmd1 && cmd2 && cmd3 && cmd4</b>
  <b>cmd1 || cmd2 || cmd3 || cmd4</b>

Semicolon tells the shell to operate sequentially.
First "cmd1" is executed, then "cmd2," etc.
Each command starts up, and runs as long as they
don't need input from the previous command.
The <b>&</b> command launches each process in a
detached manner. The order is not sequential,
and you should not assume that one command
finishes before the other.
The last two examples, like the first,
execute sequentially, as long as the status is correct.
In the <b>&&</b> example, "cmd4" is executed if all
three earlier commands pass.
In the <b>||</b> example, "cmd4" is executed if the first three fail.

  <b>cat wordoc1.txt | cat wordoc2.txt</b>

  <b>cat wordoc1.txt || cat wordoc2.txt</b>

Main difference between the two being, when the first command
is not recognized it will terminate, where as the double is
used as comparison (on failure of the first command and ignores the second).
So the comparison is unsuccessful and it runs the second command.

The technicality however of the first example is just how
we described operators by specified order of evaluation,
or the manner in which commands are processed.

<b>/proc</b> directory refers to processes currently running.
Lets print a list of registered interrupts on the system.

  <b>cat /proc/interrupts</b>
<a style="color:#646464; font-family:consolas,monospace; font-style:regular; font-size:14">
An interrupt is a signal emitted by a device
attached to a computer or from a program within
the computer. It requires the OS to stop and
figure out what to do next. An interrupt temporarily
stops or terminates a service or a current process.
Most I/O devices have a bus control line called
Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) for this purpose. 
</a>
Using the shell interactively, or one that is from
user and not running from a file, reads out of stdin.
Without an argument this is the shell's behavior.
<b>-s</b> forces shell to read stdin for commands.
Normally, the shell checks standard input, and checks
to see if it's a terminal or a file. 
If it is a terminal, then it ignores the TERMINATE
signal, which is associated with signal zero in the
trap command.
Also INTERRUPT is ignored. However, if the shell is
reading from a file, these signals are not ignored.
The <b>-i</b> option tells the shell to
not ignore these traps.
<b>-p</b> unallows changing of the effective user and
group, to whomever is the real user and group.

Basic example of an if statement

<b>if test "$(id -u)" == "0"</b>
<b>then</b>
   <b>echo</b> "This script is running as root" 
<b>else</b>
   <b>echo</b> "This script is not running as root"<b>1&gt;&amp;2</b>
   <b>exit 1</b>
<b>fi</b>

<b>id -u</b> flag is used to check the user id of
the user who is running the script. And if the user
id is not <b>0</b> that means the user is not root
and the script will print the else statement.
The 1&gt;&amp;2 is used to redirect the output to stderr.
  <em>i.e. (stderr=2, stdout=1, stdin=0)..</em>
Exit 1 will exit the script with a status code of 1,
a failure. And if we do not use exit 1 the script will
exit with a status code of <b>0</b>, a success.

It is often the case you can use the logical operators
we discussed       <b>&&</b>    <b>&</b>    <b>||</b>    <b>;</b>
in place of this type of if statement, as they share
similar behavior.

UNIX comes with two programs called true and false,
"exit 0" and "exit 1-255".
These are known as an Exit status, with integers
from 0 to 255.
The shell can either examine the integer value
of an exit status, or treat the value as a boolean.
Zero is true (successful), all other values are false.
If you do not provide an exit status,
the system returns with the status
of the last command executed.

Operators take standard input or standard output, and also return an exit status.

  <b>cat &lt;&lt; testhello</b>
  <b>&gt;</b> Hi!vehello
  <b>&gt;</b> Hollow World
  <b>testhello</b>

testhello on the last line, acts as a delimeter of this script.

‘&gt;‘ symbol is used for stdout redirection.

  <b>ls -lap &gt; /testfile</b>

This will redirect and REPLACE the output from <b>ls</b> ,
however you can append to the end of a file without replace;

  <b>ls -lap &gt;&gt; /testfile</b>

Relational operators always print a zero or one.
Options can also be relational operators used for
comparison;

  <b>==</b>      Equal to                 <b>-eq</b>
  <b>!=</b>      Not equal to             <b>-ne</b>
  <b>&gt;</b>       Greater than             <b>-gt</b>
  <b>&lt;</b>       Less than                <b>-lt</b>
  <b>&gt;=</b>      Greater than or equal to <b>-ge</b>
  <b>&lt;=</b>      Less than or equal to    <b>-le</b>


Basic structure of a case statement

  <b>FRUIT="banana"</b>
    <b>case "$FRUIT" in</b>
      <b>"apple") echo</b> "Tasty."
    <b>;;</b>
      <b>"banana") echo</b> "Yummy banana nut bread."
    <b>;;</b>
  <b>esac</b>

FRUIT was equal to banana so we got back Yummy banana nut bread.
Lets see if we can get apple in a function.

    <b>expr</b>, is used to perform arithmetic, e.g.
      <b>expr 1 + 1   expr 2 \* 2   expr 3 / 3</b>   etc.

Functions may be expressed in this way.
<em>They're a bit particular about character placement,
newlines, spacing and indentation although, you can enforce
your own tabulated construct</em>

  <b>apple(){</b>
    <b>A=$(expr $A + 1)</b>
  <b>}</b>
  <b>A=1</b>
  <b>while ["$A" -le 10]</b>
  <b>do</b>
    <b>echo $A</b>
    <b>echo</b> 'apple!'
    <b>apple</b>
  <b>done</b>
  <b>echo</b> 'yay we got ALOT of apples'


<b>For Loop</b> example;
Here's an in depth description of a working for loop;

 <b>for</b> NAME [in WORDS ... ] ; <b>do</b> COMMANDS; <b>done</b>
 Execute commands for each member in a list.

 The 'for' loop executes a sequence of commands for each member in a
 list of items.  If 'in WORDS ...;' is not present, then 'in "<b>$@</b>"' is
 assumed.  For each element in WORDS, NAME is <b>set</b> to that element, and
 the COMMANDS are executed.
<p style="color:#646464; font-family:consolas,monospace; font-style:regular; font-size:14">
Parentheses and braces
<b>( )</b> and <b>{ }</b> are analogous in some ways i.e. variables,
expansion, nesting, however they differ in a variety of ways;
most simply, parentheses work on numbers, commands as well as subshell execution.
<em>subshell refers to <b>$variable</b></em>
where as the other works by user-defined conditions/errors or groups.
Square brackets <b>[ ]</b> are similar to parentheses except you'll
see it used with conditions, arguments and expressions as
opposed to environment variables, etc.</p>
