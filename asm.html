<div class="no-select" id="asm-anch">Here's a list of all registers</div>

&emsp; <b>General-purpose registers:</b>
&emsp; - **64-bit Registers:**
&emsp;   - `rax`: Accumulator register
&emsp;   - `rbx`: Base register
&emsp;   - `rcx`: Counter register
&emsp;   - `rdx`: Data register

&emsp; - **Additional 64-bit Registers:**
&emsp;   - `rsi`: Source index register
&emsp;   - `rdi`: Destination index register
&emsp;   - `rbp`: Base pointer register
&emsp;   - `rsp`: Stack pointer register
&emsp;  
&emsp;   **16-bit and 8-bit Versions (lower part of the corresponding 32/64-bit register):**
&emsp;   - `ax`, `ah`, `al`: Accumulator (full, high, low)
&emsp;   - `bx`, `bh`, `bl`: Base (full, high, low)
&emsp;   - `cx`, `ch`, `cl`: Counter (full, high, low)
&emsp;   - `dx`, `dh`, `dl`: Data (full, high, low)
&emsp;   - ... and so on.
&emsp;  
&emsp;  <b>Special-purpose registers:</b>
&emsp;   `rip`: Instruction pointer (contains the address of the next instruction to be executed)
&emsp;   `rsp`: Stack pointer (points to the top of the stack)
&emsp;   `rbp`: Base pointer (used to point to the base of the current stack frame)
&emsp;   `flags`: Flags register (contains various condition code flags)
&emsp;   `rflags`: Full register including flags
&emsp;   `r8 - r15`: Additional general-purpose registers
&emsp;  
&emsp;  <b>Segment registers:</b>
&emsp;   `cs`: Code segment
&emsp;   `ds`: Data segment
&emsp;   `ss`: Stack segment
&emsp;   `es`, `fs`, `gs`: Extra segments (often used for additional purposes like thread-local storage)


&emsp;  <b>Function</b>/subroutine - equivalent in assembly is the "call" instruction - this'll transfer control
&emsp;  to a specified address and save the return address, allowing the program to return to the original point after the subroutine completes its execution.
&emsp;  
&emsp;  unlike higher-level languages, assembly doesn't have built-in support for structures/union. Instead, you manually manage memory and access fields using offsets.
&emsp;  
&emsp;  *Control flow** in assembly often involves manipulating flags and using conditional jumps to change the execution path.
&emsp;  
&emsp;  
&emsp;  Here's a list of instructions:
&emsp;  
&emsp;   Data Movement Instructions
&emsp;   - **mov**: Move data from source to destination
&emsp;   Arithmetic Instructions
&emsp;   - **add**, **sub**, **mul**, **div**: Integer arithmetic
&emsp;   -   e.g. **imul**, **umul**: Signed, unsigned multiplication
&emsp;   Logical Instructions
&emsp;   - **and**: Bitwise AND
&emsp;   - **or**: Bitwise OR
&emsp;   - **xor**: Bitwise XOR
&emsp;   - **not**: Bitwise NOT
&emsp;   Control Transfer Instructions
&emsp;   - **jmp**: Unconditional jump
&emsp;   - **je**, **jne**, **jg**, etc.: Conditional jumps
&emsp;   - **call**: Call a procedure or subroutine
&emsp;   - **ret**: Return from a procedure
&emsp;   Comparison Instructions
&emsp;   - **cmp**: Compare two operands
&emsp;   String Instructions
&emsp;   - **movs**: Move string
&emsp;   - **cmps**: Compare strings
&emsp;   - **scas**: Scan string
&emsp;   Stack Instructions
&emsp;   - **push**: Push data onto the stack
&emsp;   - **pop**: Pop data from the stack
&emsp;   Conditional Move Instructions
&emsp;   - **cmov**: Conditional move based on flags
&emsp;   Bit Manipulation Instructions
&emsp;   - **shl**, **shr**: Shift left/right
&emsp;   - **rol**, **ror**: Rotate left/right
&emsp;   Floating-Point Instructions
&emsp;   - **fld**, **fstp**: Load and store floating-point values
&emsp;   - **fadd**, **fsub**, **fmul**, **fdiv**: Floating-point arithmetic
&emsp;  
&emsp;  
&emsp;  Here's two main kinds of interrupts, **software** and **hardware** interrupts...
&emsp;  
&emsp;   software - identified by the "int" assembly instruction... and these trigger instructions within the program (e.g. system calls/request from os)...
&emsp;   hardware - are strictly generated by external devices or internal processor events... such as (keyboard input, timer events, disk operations)...
&emsp;   **InterruptServiceRoutines**(IRS) are special routines: i.e. they handle interrupts.
&emsp;  
&emsp;  Common data types (*size specifiers*) in assembly might include
&emsp;   Byte (**db**): 8 bits
&emsp;   Word (**dw**): 16 bits
&emsp;   Doubleword (**dd**): 32 bits
&emsp;   Quadword (**dq**): 64 bits
&emsp;  
&emsp;  
&emsp;  Assembly also has **directives** that begin with the word "section". They provide additional information to the assembler, helping with data allocation, defining sections, etc...
&emsp;  
&emsp;  *.data**: Defines a section for initialized data
&emsp;  *.bss**: Defines a section for uninitialized data
&emsp;  *.text**: Defines a section for the program's code
&emsp;  *.extern**: Declares a variable or label as external, indicating it's defined in another file
&emsp;  *.equ**: Defines a constant value
&emsp;  
&emsp;  (;) semicolon, lets you add comments
&emsp;  
&emsp;  
&emsp;  We can summarize an ASM output by describing each section, for e.g.
&emsp;  
&emsp;  . **Data Section:**
&emsp;    - **Purpose:** Reserved for initialized data, constants, and possibly space for uninitialized data (BSS).
&emsp;  
&emsp;  . **Text Section (Code Section):**
&emsp;    - **Purpose:** Contains the executable code.
&emsp;  
&emsp;  . **Function Prologue:**
&emsp;    - **Purpose:** Prepares the function for execution.
&emsp;    - **Common Steps:**
&emsp;      - Save register values that need to be preserved (`push`).
&emsp;      - Allocate space for local variables and function parameters.
&emsp;  
&emsp;  . **Function Epilogue:**
&emsp;    - **Purpose:** Cleans up after the function execution.
&emsp;    - **Common Steps:**
&emsp;      - Deallocate space for local variables and parameters (`add esp`).
&emsp;      - Restore saved register values (`pop`).
&emsp;      - Return from the function (`ret`).
&emsp;  
&emsp;  . **Additional Sections:**
&emsp;    - **Purpose:** Sections like `.bss`, `.rodata`, or custom sections may be used for specific purposes.

&emsp;  `.rodata` is associated w/ readonly data, e.g. generated using `const`
