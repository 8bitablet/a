<em>It's occurred to me that `cython` offers a significant performance increase to python through an interface that uses "C-Extensions".
It translates python into C, which can then be compiled into native machine code, and this could be particularly beneficial to working
w/ large projects remotely in my opinion. So it may be worth thinking about python within this context.</em>
