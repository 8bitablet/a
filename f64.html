   1.024e3 <em>scientific notation example</em>
including the sign(+,-), these are the parts that
comprise and describe a floating point number.
A significant difference between decimal point and
floating point is that floating points are binary,
so these have, what's known as a binary point.

standard representation of this sometimes will show
an address in <em>normalized scientific notation</em>,
split into three parts where the most significant bit
represents the sign, then 8 bits for the exponent and
the remaining bits toward the <em>trailing significand</em>
or rather, the mantissa with its leading 1 omitted.
This address is normalized first after conversion to
the form of a Ã— 10^n. <b>0</b> takes the form of all zero's
to clearly illustrate the use of zero.
Now that's just the finite numbers but there's also inifinty
and a special value called 'not a number'.
For now this is enough to prime someone before using this
type unconsciously

  int main()  {
    int64_t x = 1024;
    double fp = 4096.1234;

    printf("int64 value : %d", x);
    printf("64bit fp value : %f", fp);
    printf("x and fp : %f", (x+fp));
    return 0;
  }

use case of format specifiers and 64bit floating-point
w/ multiple varieties in a print statement

double a = 1234.56789;
double b = 299792458;
double c = 6.62607e-34;

printf("Using %%f (fixed point): %f %f %f . \n", a, b, c);
printf("Using %%e (force exponent): %e %e %e . \n", a, b, c);
printf("Using %%g (best fit): %g %g %g . \n", a, b, c);
