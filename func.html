<div id="data-anch">data type</div>
char type is considered a small integer type
its typically used to represent characters
however those characters have to be stored as integer values
(thus, small integer type)

<div id="void-anch">void pointer</div>
they can point to objects of any data type
"void" btw just means "no return type"
where as int functions must include a return type

<div id="variadic-anch">variadic function</div>
since we use `printf` to see the results of everything
we should understand what kind of function it is
its a special function that takes a variable amount of arguments,
that is, they are presented with an ellipsis "..." within a given function's parameters
<span class="alt-text">
  int printf(const char *format, ...)</span>

this is the definition provided by the standard lib header, so linking w/
`#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;`
lets you use `printf`. keep in mind, you include C library headers w/ &lt;file.h&gt;
and user-defined headers w/ "file.h"
<span class="alt-text">
  printf("Example text %d, %d, %d\n", var1, var2, var3);</span>

So here we are demonstrating what both a
function declaration is, and how `printf` works.
Because its a variadic function, it could conceivably take an inifinite amount of variables
... simply put, the first part ("in quotation marks") will accept your
personalized text as well as format specifiers.
these format specifiers align with each proceeding variable (found after the comma)
`printf` in particular is used for printing formatted output to the screen, hence print -f(formatted)

lets get back to the specifics of a function
functions bring a specific set of instructions depending on how you define them...
to see how they pertain to their assembly counterpart, see page10

lets say you create a function prototype
that is, you want to tell the program that
theres a function defined somewhere
and you want to call it
<span class="alt-text">
  void func(int x);</span>

it would have to find this function defined within the program
<span class="alt-text">
  void func(int x) {
  }</span>

one notable feature related to a function is the ability to
capture the internal instructions of a function

/* IMPORTANT */
since this is our first example, you should remember that
all program instructions are called out from `int main` first,
and then proceed to the rest of the program
<span class="alt-text">
  int func(int a,int b) {
    int c = a+b;
  }

  int main() {
    int a2 = 2;
    int b2 = 3;
    int internfunc = func(a2, b2);
    printf("internfunc is %d\n", internfunc);
    return 0;
  }</span>

we explicitly declared new variables in `main` to show
`internfunc` could have the same arguments as func and we
could rename/reassign those parameters as well


<div id="function-pointer-anch">function pointer</div>
first create the function
<span class="alt-text">
  void Function(int param) {
  }</span>

declare a function pointer
<span class="alt-text">
  void (*pointerToFunction)(int);</span>

assign the function pointer
to point to the function's address
(capture its internal instructions)
<span class="alt-text">
  pointerToFunction = &amp;Function;</span>

now its equal to some original function we had
in this example you dont even need to include braces,
but you should note that you dont include void anyway
when you call a void function from within another function

however function origins that do not have parameters should
be filled out with void i.e. `func(void) {}`

last but not least, you can call the function through the function pointer,
and assign a value to its parameter
<span class="alt-text">
  pointerToFunction(42);</span>

here's the next example
<span class="alt-text">
  void ThisFunction(void (*NewParam)(int));</span>

you might also call this the function pointer's signature
it would have to find this function defined within the
program
<span class="alt-text">
  void ThisFunction(void (*NewParam)(int)) {
  }</span>

continuing on, heres a function that matches its signature
<span class="alt-text">
  void SomeNewFunction(int Param) {
  }</span>

you can call it now since it shares the same signature
<span class="alt-text">
  ThisFunction(&amp;SomeNewFunction);</span>

note: keep in mind, im just cycling through everything thats possible with functions,
and once you understand function pointers and matching signatures,
rest assured everything else will be a cakewalk

you can also have a function thats of `struct` type such as this constructor function
<span class="alt-text">
  struct unboundedint {
  };

  struct unboundedint constructor(int num_blocks) {
    struct unboundedint result;
  }<span>
