<span class="alt-text">
  int *B;
  int *A = B;
  int *C = A;
  int *D = C;</span>

experiment w/ this in the context of type-casting back nd forth
and using different Types..
<span class="alt-text">
  int A = 4;
  int *ptr;
  ptr = &amp;A;</span>

use the %p specifier and &amp;A to print out an address
or declare `*ptr` again to dereference the original pointer
<span class="alt-text">
  int value = *ptr;</span>

you can use objects before they are explicitly assigned/defined
this is called "digression"

you can use pointers when passing the address of a variable
to a function. this function can then modify the original value
through the pointer (note: you can also pass value, address,
array and struct w/ parameters)
<span class="alt-text">
  void accessExample(int *ptr) {
    *ptr = 1;
  }</span>

we can access the address of said variable
from another function like so
<span class="alt-text">
  void anotherFunction(int *ptr) {
    printf("access in another function %d\n", *ptr);
  }</span>

yes, its that simple...
so in short, pointers allow direct access to a memory address
providing a way to manipulate and interact with data at a low level
its essential for tasks like memory allocation (`malloc`) and
working with complex data structures.
passing a pointer to a function is often more efficient than passing
large data structures by value
this is because only the memory address is passed, not the whole data
