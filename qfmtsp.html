<div id="fmt-anch">format specifier</div>
this example demonstrates the more common data types
available, as well as which format specifier to use
they are to infer what type of data should be printed
or scanned in input and output operations... ...
(we'll go over what all of that means as we progress)
<span class="alt-text">
  int main() {  
    printf("query format specifiers\n");
    printf("%d | i (signed integer)\n");
    printf("%u (unsigned integer)\n");
    printf("%o (unsigned octal)\n");
    printf("%x (unsigned hexadecimal)\n");
    printf("%f (decimal floating point)\n");
    printf("%e (scientific notation)\n");
    printf("%a (hexadecimal floating point)\n");
    printf("%c (character)\n");
    printf("%s (string of characters)\n");
    printf("%p (pointer address)\n");

    return 0;
  }</span>

<div id="storage-class-anch">storage class specifier</div>
`static` is used to specify the storage duration (lifetime) and linkage (visibility) of a variable
when used as a local variable within a function, it makes the variable retain its value
between function calls and gives it internal linkage
when used w/ a global variable or function, it gives said variable internal linkage, which means
the variable is visible only within the same translation unit (the same source file)
`extern` is used to declare a variable or function that is defined in another file or translation unit
it specifies that the variable or function has external linkage (visible across multiple translation units)

<div id="type-qualifier-anch">type qualifier</div>
`const` it is used to specify that a variable's value cannot be modified after initialization
consider it also a form of documentation and a contract with the caller that a function shouldnt
attempt to modify the provided variable, i.e. its a constant (in one way or another)

unary/binary operator

logical operators: &amp;&amp;, ||, !
arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %, ++, --
something to note, about post/pre increment operators is that they affect a variable within its lifetime!...
... even if its being assigned as a product of another variable (except as a For loop "expression")
relational operator: ==, !=, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=
bitwise operators: &amp;, |, ^, ~, &lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt;
assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &lt;&lt;=, &gt;&gt;=, &amp;=, ^=, |=


todo: look up the following terms, as you can often get them mixed up,
modifiers (modify other identifiers), quantifiers (in mathematics they specify quantities of a set)
identifiers (the names of the entities in the programming language), delimeters (specify boundaries)
