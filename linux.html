&emsp;&emsp; Introduction to Linux &amp; Systems

&emsp;&emsp;   /Dir/    = absolute directory
&emsp;&emsp;   /Dir     = absolute filedirectory
&emsp;&emsp;    Dir/    = relative directory
&emsp;&emsp;    Dir     = relative filedirectory

&emsp;&emsp; absolute just means it includes the full address of your dir back to root.
&emsp;&emsp; relative traces from current working directory, i.e. parent or subdirectory.
&emsp;&emsp; Bonus: everythings a file.

&emsp;&emsp; Access Control (Permissions)

&emsp;&emsp;       11          10           9
&emsp;&emsp;        |           |           |
&emsp;&emsp; 8  7   6     5  4  3    2  1   0
&emsp;&emsp; r  w  x/s   r  w  x/s   r  w  x/t
&emsp;&emsp;     U           G          O 

&emsp;&emsp; The twelve bits are fitted into nine characters. There is also the character triplet
&emsp;&emsp; represented as: User, Group, and Other. Each of these three ID's contain three types;
&emsp;&emsp; read, write, and execute. Read can be '<b>r</b>' or '<b>-</b>' meaning no special permission.
&emsp;&emsp; Write is '<b>w</b>' or '<b>-</b>' no special permission. And Execute is
&emsp;&emsp; '<b>x</b>' execute or '<b>s</b>' both bits are set, '<b>-</b>',
&emsp;&emsp; or '<b>t</b>' is the sticky bit, which gives the file owner permission.
&emsp;&emsp; Note: The very first character not shown here is the advanced flag,
&emsp;&emsp; represented as either '<b>d</b>' for directory or '<b>-</b>' for file.

&emsp;&emsp; Permissions can be represented in a binary reference called decimal,
&emsp;&emsp; where <b>r</b>=4, <b>w</b>=2, and <b>e</b>=1
&emsp;&emsp; so with this algorithm you add them together
&emsp;&emsp; to get each ID's permission you want to set.
